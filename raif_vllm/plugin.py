"""The single `vllm.general_plugins` entrypoint: `register()`.

Loaded once at vLLM engine import (in every engine process). It wires RAIF into
a stock vLLM server with no proxy and no client changes:

  1. registers the `raif` reasoning parser (decode RAIF-G -> JSON content) and
     the `raif` tool parser (decode RAIF-G -> tool_calls) by importing their
     modules, whose `@...Manager.register_module("raif")` decorators self-register;
  2. monkeypatches `OpenAIServingRender.render_chat` so the compact `<schema>`
     cue is injected into the prompt BEFORE chat templating — the only in-process
     seam that sees the full request pre-template (the tool-parser `adjust_request`
     hook fires too late). For the `response_format` path it also neutralizes
     vLLM's native JSON guided-decoding so the model is free to emit RAIF-G.

Everything degrades to a no-op when vLLM (or the specific seam) is absent, so the
entrypoint is import-safe on any machine. Wire it up in `pyproject.toml`:

    [project.entry-points."vllm.general_plugins"]
    raif = "raif_vllm.plugin:register"

Verified end-to-end on vLLM 0.19.0 (CUDA-12, A40): plain chat / tools / json_schema
`response_format` all decode correctly through this one plugin.
