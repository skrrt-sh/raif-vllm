# vLLM End-to-End Results: RAIF single plugin

Status: **Single `raif-vllm` plugin verified on vLLM 0.19 (A40). 4/5 OpenAI paths
PASS; streaming `response_format` is a documented known limitation.**

This document is the GPU end-to-end (e2e) test-results artifact for the RAIF vLLM
integration on RunPod. It has two parts: the **current** single-plugin run on
vLLM 0.19 (the `general_plugins` entry-point model — tools, `response_format`,
`json_object`, plain chat), and the **original** tool-call finding on vLLM 0.11
(the chat-template prompt-parity fix, still in force).

## Current: single-plugin e2e (vLLM 0.19, A40)

Served `unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct` + LoRA `skrrt-sh/raif-llama-3.2-3b-lora`
with `VLLM_PLUGINS=raif --reasoning-parser raif --enable-auto-tool-choice
--tool-call-parser raif` and the tools-ignoring `--chat-template`
(`scripts/serve_smoke.sh`), then drove all five paths through a plain
OpenAI client (`examples/smoke_plugin.py`):

| Path | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| plain chat | ✅ PASS | untouched passthrough |
| tools | ✅ PASS | `get_weather` → JSON `tool_calls`, RAIF-G wire = 13 tok |
| `response_format` (`json_schema`) | ✅ PASS | decoded to JSON content; **13 vs 16 tok JSON → −19%** |
| `response_format` (`json_object`) | ✅ PASS | schemaless decode to valid JSON |
| `response_format` **streaming** | ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATION | client receives raw RAIF-G, **undecoded** |

### Streaming `response_format` — known limitation (root cause)

Verified on vLLM 0.19 by instrumenting the parser: streaming structured output is
**not decoded**. The reasoning parser's `is_reasoning_end()` must return `True` so
the *tools* streaming path engages the tool parser (vLLM only runs
`extract_tool_calls_streaming` after reasoning ends). That same `True` trips
vLLM's `prompt_is_reasoning_end` gate, which routes every generated token straight
to content as raw text — `extract_reasoning_streaming` is never even called for
the `response_format` path. A single shared parser cannot return both `True`
(tools) and `False` (response_format): the streaming seam passes no `request`, and
tools/response_format generations are token-identical RAIF-G. The LoRA also emits
no RAIF-G terminator, so there is no incremental signal to decode against. A real
fix needs a framing terminator (retrain) or a vLLM-side per-request streaming hook.
**Use non-streaming `response_format` for structured output — it works fully.**

## Original: tool-call finding (vLLM 0.11)

The sections below record the first GPU run (vLLM 0.11, file-based tool parser)
that surfaced the chat-template prompt-parity issue. The `--chat-template` fix it
produced is still load-bearing in the current flow.

## What was run

The e2e run served the fine-tuned RAIF-G model behind an OpenAI-compatible vLLM
endpoint and exercised the tool-call path through the `raif` parser plugin.

- **Hardware:** RunPod A40 (NVIDIA driver CUDA 12.9 / "12090").
- **Model:** base `unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct` + LoRA
  `skrrt-sh/raif-llama-3.2-3b-lora` (rank 32).
- **Serving:** vLLM OpenAI server with the `raif` `ToolParser` plugin
  (`src/raif_vllm.py` — the pre-package file in the raif-lora repo, before this
  plugin was split out), `--enable-auto-tool-choice`, and the LoRA loaded as an
  adapter.
- **Decoder:** `raif.decode` from the `raif-format` package (RAIF-G → arguments dict).
- **Client probe:** a chat-completions request with `tools=[get_weather]` and
  `tool_choice="auto"`, plus a parallel raw-completion probe that bypasses vLLM's
  tool template.

## Final working stack / version matrix

| component    | working pin           | notes                                            |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| vLLM         | `0.11.0`              | torch 2.8.0+cu128, runs on the A40 driver 12.9   |
| torch        | `2.8.0+cu128`         | bundled with vLLM 0.11.0; CUDA 12.8 build         |
| transformers | `4.57.x` (`>=4.56,<5`)| keeps `all_special_tokens_extended` for vLLM 0.11 |
| python       | `python3.12`          | the image's real interpreter with torch/vLLM      |

### Why the stock image fails, and how the pins resolve it

The stock RunPod image (`runpod/pytorch:...-cu1290`) ships **torch 2.9 / cu130 +
transformers 5.x**. Two independent failures result:

1. **Latest vLLM (0.23.0) crashes on the A40.** Its torch requires a CUDA-13
   driver, but the A40 host driver is CUDA 12.9:

   ```
   NVIDIA driver too old, found version 12090
   ```

   Pinning `vllm==0.11.0` pulls `torch 2.8.0+cu128`, a CUDA-12.8 build that runs
   correctly on driver 12.9.

2. **transformers 5.x breaks vLLM 0.11 tokenizer init.** transformers 5.x removed
   `all_special_tokens_extended`, which vLLM 0.11's tokenizer initialization calls:

   ```
   TokenizersBackend has no attribute all_special_tokens_extended
   ```

   Pinning `transformers>=4.56,<5` (resolves to 4.57.x) restores the attribute.

Additional environment note: in the image, plain `python3` is an empty 3.10; the
interpreter that actually has torch/vLLM is `python3.12`. All commands below use
`python3.12`.

## Results

### Plugin shim tests: 17/17 PASS

The plugin shim test suite passes **17/17 against real vLLM 0.11 types**. This
includes the 3 `importorskip` tests that skip on Mac (no vLLM there) and run on the
GPU host where vLLM 0.11 is installed. The decoder is exercised and is correct.

### Live smoke: FAILED (tool-call path)

With the client passing `tools=[...]` and `tool_choice="auto"`, the server returned
a syntactically valid JSON tool call with the correct function name
(`get_weather`), but the **arguments were the tool schema echoed back** rather than
extracted values:

```json
{"function": {"function": {"name": "get_weather", "parameters": {...}}}}
```

### Raw-path proof: model emits correct RAIF

Using the same prompt plus the exact `<schema>` cue the plugin injects, but
**without** vLLM's tool template, the model emitted correct RAIF-G:

```
city=Oslo
unit=celsius
```

which `raif.decode` turns into:

```json
{"city": "Oslo", "unit": "celsius"}
```

The cue injected by the plugin's `adjust_request` was:

```
<schema>
city:s
unit:s
</schema>
```

The raw path and the tool-call path differ in exactly one way — whether vLLM also
rendered the OpenAI tool-definition JSON into the prompt — which isolates the cause.

## Root-cause analysis

The gap is a **prompt-format mismatch**, not a parser or decoder defect.

- **Training format (bare cue).** Per `docs/fine_tune_plan.md` (in the
  raif-standard repo, https://github.com/skrrt-sh/raif-standard), each training
  example's user turn is `"<request>\n\n<schema>\n<declaration>\n</schema>"`
  (§3.1), using the compact RAIF-native schema grammar (§3.2:
  `name:s` / `name:n` / `name:b` / `name:t`, `name[]:s`, `name.sub:b`, `name:s?`).
  Line 209: "Prompts skip the spec block and few-shot examples — pass only the
  request + optional `<schema>` declaration." Training rendered messages with
  `tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages)` and **no** `tools=` argument, so the
  base template's tool branch never fired during training.

- **Tool-call path (double injection).** When the client passes `tools=[...]`,
  vLLM's chat template renders the verbose OpenAI tool-definition JSON into the
  prompt **on top of** the plugin's `<schema>` cue. The LoRA never saw the verbose
  tool defs, so it mimics/echoes them instead of producing RAIF arguments — hence
  the `{"function":{"function":{...}}}` schema echo.

- **Conclusion.** The raw-path proof (`city=Oslo\nunit=celsius` →
  `{"city":"Oslo","unit":"celsius"}`) plus 17/17 shim tests show the parser and
  decoder are correct. The model only misbehaves when the prompt deviates from
  training parity by carrying the extra tool-definition JSON.

## Fix applied

Serve vLLM with a **custom `--chat-template`** that renders only the messages and
ignores the `tools` variable. The model then receives exactly
`"<request>\n\n<schema>\n...\n</schema>"` (the plugin's `adjust_request` already
injects the `<schema>` cue into the last user message) — exact training parity.

Design constraints honored by this fix:

- **Keep `request.tools` set (do NOT null it).** Both vLLM's
  `--enable-auto-tool-choice` gating and the plugin's `extract_tool_calls` read
  `request.tools`. Only the *template* must drop the tool rendering; nulling
  `request.tools` in `adjust_request` would break both gates.
- **Do not retrain on verbose tool defs.** That would discard RAIF's input-token
  savings, which the compact `<schema>` cue exists to provide.

See `docs/vllm_tool_calling.md` for the full template and serving wiring.

## Reproduce

Current flow (vLLM 0.19, entry-point plugin) — `scripts/serve_smoke.sh`
encodes all of this; see `docs/runpod_testing.md` for the RunPod runbook. In
short: get this repo onto the box (clone it, or rsync this one tree) under
`$WORKROOT`, then on the box:

```bash
WORKROOT=/workspace/raif bash scripts/serve_smoke.sh
```

It installs `vllm==0.19.0` + `fastapi==0.115.6`, editable-installs this repo
(`pip install -e .`, which pulls `raif-format>=0.6` from PyPI),
serves base + LoRA with `VLLM_PLUGINS=raif --reasoning-parser raif
--enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser raif` and the tools-ignoring
`--chat-template chat_templates/raif_llama32.jinja`, then runs
`examples/smoke_plugin.py` across all five paths.

The original 0.11 run pinned `vllm==0.11.0` + `transformers>=4.56,<5` and used the
file-based `--tool-parser-plugin`; that path is superseded by the entry-point
plugin above. v0.19 is the **last CUDA-12 vLLM** — newer vLLM ships cu130 torch
and crashes on a CUDA-12 driver with "driver too old, found version 12090".
